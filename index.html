<p>My name is Justin, and I write free software (the libre kind). I generally stick to game development, but I&rsquo;ll occasionally tinker with other free software projects. I also have an obsession with the anime/manga series, Hidamari Sketch.</p>

<h2>Projects</h2>

<p>(To see a full list of things I&rsquo;ve hacked on, check out my <a href="https://github.com/dorkster?tab=repositories">Github profile</a>)</p>

<h3><a href="http://flarerpg.org/">Flare</a></h3>

<p>Clint Bellanger&rsquo;s Flare is a fantastic free-software action RPG, similar to the Diablo series. I&rsquo;ve been helping with development since March of 2012. Most of my programming time is now spent on Flare, be it small bugfixes or brand new features. It&rsquo;s nice to be able to work on an ambitious project that still has a relatively simplistic codebase.</p>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/dorkster/freeblocks">Freeblocks</a></h3>

<p>My January 2013 OneGameAMonth project. I had always wanted to make a puzzle game like Tetris Attack. I&rsquo;m pleased with how this one turned out. It&rsquo;s not as complete as Tetris Attack, but it&rsquo;s still a lot of fun to play. I picked this back up in February 2015 after receiving patches for a GCW-Zero port. It has since gotten a new game mode and other improvements.</p>

<h3><a href="http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-31/?action=preview&amp;uid=44489">Noman&rsquo;s Dungeon</a></h3>

<p>This is a turn-based, rogue-like created for Ludum Dare #31. The goal is to travel to the last floor, retrieve the elusive trophy, and return to the surface. Some of my thoughts on the game and its development are in <a href="blog_2014-12-09_10-02-52.html">this blog post</a>.</p>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/dorkster/feedreader">Feedreader</a></h3>

<p>This is a really simple RSS reader made with GTK2 that sits in the system tray. Most of the RSS readers I used before were either bloated GUIs or CLI only. I wanted to make a lightweight GUI program to fit in between those two extremes. I don&rsquo;t personally use this anymore, since I no longer subscribe to any RSS feeds. It&rsquo;s still a neat little program and was my first experience developing something with GTK2.</p>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/dorkster/tilesetdef-generator">Flare Tileset Definition Generator</a></h3>

<p>A simple Python script that can take a <a href="http://mapeditor.org/">Tiled</a> *.tmx file and create a tileset definition file for Flare. In addition, it uses ImageMagick to combine all of the tileset images into a single image file. It might be a bit out of date, since Flare&rsquo;s map format could have changed a bit since this was written.</p>
