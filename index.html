        <span class="project-grid-item-category">Action Role Playing Game</span><br/>
        <img src="images/projects/flare.jpg" class="img-fade"/>
        Clint Bellanger's Flare is a fantastic free-software action RPG, similar to the Diablo series. I've been helping with development since March of 2012 and have since become the lead developer.

        <a class="project-grid-item-title" href="https://github.com/dorkster/transit-log-system">Transit Log System</a><br/>
        <span class="project-grid-item-category">Website</span><br/>
        <img src="images/projects/coa_transit.jpg" class="img-fade">
        Originally developed for the Stow, MA Council on Aging for their transportation needs. The system provides an easy method for staff to create daily schedules, which drivers can then use to log mileage and fuel data. Drivers are given a mobile-friendly interface for working with the schedule on the road, along with pre-trip reports and vehicle maintenance status. Monthly reports can be generated with the recorded data, as well as additional information about the clients.

        <span class="project-grid-item-category">Puzzle Game</span><br/>
        <img src="images/projects/freeblocks.jpg" class="img-fade"/>
        Created as my January 2013 OneGameAMonth project, Freeblocks is a game similar to Tetris Attack. While not a direct clone, it's still quite fun to play.

        <a class="project-grid-item-title" href="http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-31/?action=preview&amp;uid=44489">Noman's Dungeon</a><br/>
        <span class="project-grid-item-category">Turn-based Role Playing Game</span><br/>
        <img src="images/projects/nomans_dungeon.jpg" class="img-fade"/>
        This is a turn-based, rogue-like created for Ludum Dare #31. The goal is to travel to the last floor, retrieve the elusive trophy, and return to the surface. After the game jam was finished, <a href="nomans_dungeon.html">I wrote about the process and the end result</a>.

    <div class="project-grid-item">
        <a class="project-grid-item-title" href="https://github.com/dorkster/feedreader">feedreader</a><br/>
        <span class="project-grid-item-category">Linux Desktop Utility</span><br/>
        A simple GTK2-based RSS reader that sits in the system tray. It displays a simple list of articles per feed, each of which can be opened in a web browser. I don't personally use this anymore, but it was my first experience making something with GTK2.

        <a class="project-grid-item-title" href="https://github.com/dorkster/keylock-tray">keylock-tray</a><br/>
        <span class="project-grid-item-category">Linux Desktop Utility</span><br/>
        Much to my disappointment, many modern laptops don't have LEDs for CapsLock and NumLock. So I created a program that displays their status as tray icons. It uses GTK2 and XKB and features command line flags to change the background/foreground colors of the icons.

        In 2019, I was asked to redesign the website for the charity organization, <em>Bridges to Malawi</em>. I was happy to oblige, and after a brief bit of iteration, came to a result that we were both happy with. The primary goals were to give the site a more professional look, while also better highlighting the pillars of the organization's work.<br/>
        Along with the website design, I also created an introductory video to be used on their main page.

<h2 id="more-about">More About Me</h2>
<div class="about">
    <h3>My interests / hobbies</h3>
        <ul class="flat-list">
        <li>Video games. Too many favorites to list here, but my top genres include action RPGs, "Metroidvanias", first person shooters, and puzzle games.</li>
        <li>Japanese anime and manga. My two stand-out favorite series are <i>Hidamari Sketch</i> and <i>Outlaw Star</i>.</li>
        <li>Late 80s/early 90s Lego, namely the Town, Space, and Castle themes.</li>
        <li>Tinkering with hobby electronics, Arduino, etc. I'm fairly new to this, so there's much for me to learn. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtM5z2gkrGRuWd0JQMx76qA">Big Clive's Youtube channel</a> is the catalyst for my continued interest in electronics.</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Why "dorkster"?</h3>
    Somewhere around when Team Fortress 2 was released, I started using something from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexter%27s_Laboratory">Dexter's Laboratory</a> as my Steam name. I don't remember how, but it eventually mutated into "Dorkster". I kind of got attached to it, as it has some nice properties:
    <ul class="flat-list">
        <li>8 characters; a nice power of 2.</li>
        <li>Can be shortened to 4 characters for old games that don't allow the full 8 characters. 4 also happens to be a power of 2.</li>
        <li>Despite being simple, it usually isn't already taken when registering a new username. If it's taken, I usually prefix it with my initials, "jaj".</li>
        <li>I'm a bit of a dork, so it's fitting.</li>
    </ul>
