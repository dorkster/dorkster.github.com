Flare is close to version 1.0 now (probably the billionth time I've said that). This week, I plan to tackle a big chunk of what's left for engine work. My game-plan is as follows:

- Remove the **--game** command line flag. It's functionality will be replaced in the form of a mod setting as outlined [here](https://github.com/clintbellanger/flare-engine/issues/1111).
- Scan over all TODOs and FIXMEs across the code base and attempt to eliminate as many as possible.
- Fix possible bugs detected by Coverity Scan
