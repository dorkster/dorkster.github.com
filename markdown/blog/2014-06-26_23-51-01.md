Today, I fixed up a [few last things](https://github.com/clintbellanger/flare-engine/pull/1107) pertaining to joystick support. These changes make it possible to change joystick button bindings via the configuration menu, as well as unbind keys completely.

In addition, I finally fixed a bug with WidgetScrollBox. When dragging the knob of a scrollbar attached to a WidgetScrollBox, it was impossible to scroll all the way to the bottom.
