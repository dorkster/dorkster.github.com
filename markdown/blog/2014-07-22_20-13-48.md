So Clint filled me in on his plans for the Empyrean campaign. I now have a better grasp on the theme of each map along the path of the main path, so my map concepts should start to fit more closely with the storyline. Today's map is the Book of the Dead, a simple chamber that appears early on, but isn't fully used until later in the game.
