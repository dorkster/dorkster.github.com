I took a break from [working on Flare](http://flarerpg.org/blog/20161016) to spend some time on an old project of mine, [feedreader](https://github.com/dorkster/feedreader). My goal was to create a GUI configuration screen to make it easier to set up. It was a great exercise in creating something with GTK, as I've only really done stuff with tray status icons. Here's a look at the result as of now:

This is great for people who don't like mucking about with text file configuration. However, I should probably think about adding some buttons to change the order of appearance of the feeds.

I also worked on a [small app](https://github.com/dorkster/keylock-tray) to show the status of Caps/Num lock keys in the system tray. I needed this because my new laptop doesn't have LEDs for these states, which I think is kind of crazy.
