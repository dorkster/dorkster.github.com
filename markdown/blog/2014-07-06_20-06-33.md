One week later, I've finished all the tasks I had set out to complete on Flare. I'm very happy with the removal of the --game flag, since I feared that would cause a lot of cases where people couldn't launch their game.

I was also able to take care of all the critical TODOs, FIXMEs, and static analysis related bugs. The engine is pretty solid, so I forsee us moving into the feature freeze/bug testing and translation stages soon.
