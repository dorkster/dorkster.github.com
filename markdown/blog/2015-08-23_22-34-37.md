Today, I finished laying out the first map of the first major dungeon in the Empyrean campaign. The area it is a part of is tentatively named *Lochport Tower*, but there's a good chance that will change.

The center area is vertically symmetrical, and the outer ring is horizontally symmetrical. Both combined create a shape that I really like. From a gameplay perspective, the player will travel clockwise around the outer ring. At 3 o'clock, there will be a mini-boss defending some treasure chests. One of the chests will contain a key that will unlock the door to the next level in the center area.
