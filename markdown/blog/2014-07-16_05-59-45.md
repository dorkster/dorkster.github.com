Engine work for Flare has slowed down a lot, so I decided to start brainstorming some new map ideas. The [plan for maps](https://github.com/clintbellanger/flare-game/wiki/Map-Guide) in the Empyrean campaign shows that we plan to have a lot of places to visit. The map I worked on tonight fits in between the goblin camp and the bridge area. It's a coastal area featuring two fisherman's shacks and a short cave (will be another map). Here's a preview of how it looks so far:
