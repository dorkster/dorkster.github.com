<h2>Abandoned Projects</h2>

<ul>
    <li><b><a href="https://github.com/dorkster/espada2">Espada 2</a></b> - My April 2013 OneGameAMonth project. I wanted to revisit Espada using the engine I've been developing through OneGameAMonth. Instead of making things completely random, enemy "waves" are pre-determined. Each wave increases in difficulty until reaching a boss. After the boss is defeated, it loops back around to the beginning so that gameplay lasts forever. The game features 3D models rendered as 2D for graphics and game data configuration via plain text files.</li>
    <li><b><a href="https://github.com/dorkster/woods">Woods</a></b> - My February 2013 OneGameAMonth project. The goal of the game is to balance on a log to get across the river. Not really a complex game, but I've heard it's nice to play on a laptop with an accelerometer.</li>
    <li><b><a href="https://github.com/dorkster/freeblocks">FreeBlocks</a></b> - My January 2013 OneGameAMonth project. I had always wanted to make a puzzle game like Tetris Attack. I'm pleased with how this one turned out. It's not as complete as Tetris Attack, but it's still a lot of fun to play.</li>
    <li><b><a href="https://github.com/dorkster/block-breaker">Block Breaker</a></b> - An Arkanoid/Breakout clone that I made to learn about drawing primitive shapes with the SDL_gfx package. The ball physics are not very good, but I didn't spend much time working on this.</li>
    <li><b><a href="https://github.com/dorkster/espada">Espada</a></b> - This was my first true game made with C and SDL. While not a terrible game, I made a lot of mistakes back then. I plan to rewrite and redesign this game as one of my 2013 OneGameAMonth projects.</li>
