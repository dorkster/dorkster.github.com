<p>Engine work for Flare has slowed down a lot, so I decided to start brainstorming some new map ideas. The <a href="https://github.com/clintbellanger/flare-game/wiki/Map-Guide">plan for maps</a> in the Empyrean campaign shows that we plan to have a lot of places to visit. The map I worked on tonight fits in between the goblin camp and the bridge area. It's a coastal area featuring two fisherman's shacks and a short cave (will be another map). Here's a preview of how it looks so far:</p>

<p>Tonight, I hacked together a <a href="https://github.com/clintbellanger/flare-engine/pull/1125">set of features</a> for Flare that I've had on the back burner for a while now. The save system in Flare was hard-coded to automatically save whenever the player moved to a new map, or when they quit the game. The problem with this is that it becomes easy to "cheese" death when the game gets hard by simply closing the window. Maybe that's okay for the game that we'll initally be making, since plain-text save files make cheating easy enough anyway. However, I think making this area flexible is important for creating other games, as save points can be important to the pacing of a game.</p>

<p>One week later, I've finished all the tasks I had set out to complete on Flare. I'm very happy with the removal of the --game flag, since I feared that would cause a lot of cases where people couldn't launch their game.</p>

<p>I was also able to take care of all the critical TODOs, FIXMEs, and static analysis related bugs. The engine is pretty solid, so I forsee us moving into the feature freeze/bug testing and translation stages soon.</p>

<p>Flare is close to version 1.0 now (probably the billionth time I've said that). This week, I plan to tackle a big chunk of what's left for engine work. My game-plan is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Remove the <strong>--game</strong> command line flag. It's functionality will be replaced in the form of a mod setting as outlined <a href="https://github.com/clintbellanger/flare-engine/issues/1111">here</a>.</li>
<li>Scan over all TODOs and FIXMEs across the code base and attempt to eliminate as many as possible.</li>
<li>Fix possible bugs detected by Coverity Scan</li>
</ul>

<p>Today, I fixed up a <a href="https://github.com/clintbellanger/flare-engine/pull/1107">few last things</a> pertaining to joystick support. These changes make it possible to change joystick button bindings via the configuration menu, as well as unbind keys completely.</p>

<p>In addition, I finally fixed a bug with WidgetScrollBox. When dragging the knob of a scrollbar attached to a WidgetScrollBox, it was impossible to scroll all the way to the bottom.</p>
