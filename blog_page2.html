<h2>2014/08/01 19:32:05</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been a little inactive for the past week. I lost my internet connection for a few days, so I got into playing some single-player games in my free time instead of working. However, I think I&rsquo;m ready to get back into the swing of things. Today, I <a href="https://github.com/clintbellanger/flare-engine/issues/1134">outlined my idea</a> for a developer menu to add to Flare. I think it will make creating and iterating on the Empyrean campaign easier once it&rsquo;s implemented.</p>

<p>So Clint filled me in on his plans for the Empyrean campaign. I now have a better grasp on the theme of each map along the path of the main path, so my map concepts should start to fit more closely with the storyline. Today&rsquo;s map is the Book of the Dead, a simple chamber that appears early on, but isn&rsquo;t fully used until later in the game.</p>

<p>I mapped out the cave area for the coastal map I posted the other day. I personally like how the exit is visible near the entrance of the map. The lootable barrel teases the player a bit and makes them want to travel there.</p>

<p>Engine work for Flare has slowed down a lot, so I decided to start brainstorming some new map ideas. The <a href="https://github.com/clintbellanger/flare-game/wiki/Map-Guide">plan for maps</a> in the Empyrean campaign shows that we plan to have a lot of places to visit. The map I worked on tonight fits in between the goblin camp and the bridge area. It&rsquo;s a coastal area featuring two fisherman&rsquo;s shacks and a short cave (will be another map). Here&rsquo;s a preview of how it looks so far:</p>

<p>Tonight, I hacked together a <a href="https://github.com/clintbellanger/flare-engine/pull/1125">set of features</a> for Flare that I&rsquo;ve had on the back burner for a while now. The save system in Flare was hard-coded to automatically save whenever the player moved to a new map, or when they quit the game. The problem with this is that it becomes easy to &ldquo;cheese&rdquo; death when the game gets hard by simply closing the window. Maybe that&rsquo;s okay for the game that we&rsquo;ll initally be making, since plain-text save files make cheating easy enough anyway. However, I think making this area flexible is important for creating other games, as save points can be important to the pacing of a game.</p>
